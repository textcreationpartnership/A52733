1. A
PROPOSAL
For Amending the
Silver Coins
OF
ENGLAND, &c.

    _ A PROPOSAL to have all
the Silver Mony of England Melted
down, and made New, and to be of the
same Weight and Standard, as the
New Mill'd Mony now is, or of more;
and that the Loss which thereby will
happen to those who have Clipt Mony,
will be so inconsiderable, that even they
themselves shall be willing to bring in
their Mony to be new Coined, and that
the Diminution of the Numerical quantity
of Mony, which will happen by the
Melting it down, will be more than
supplied.

    _ Some Observations upon a Project,
Presented on the 4th of January
1694/5, to the Right Honourable
the Lords of the Treasury, by L. G.

    _ A COMPUTATION, by which it appeareth, that the
Silver Coin of England being Rated to be Five Millions,
is probably Clipt one with another of 33 ⅓ per Cent. and upon
the whole, by Mr. Gervaize's Method, the King shall
lose 150000 l. or 3 per Cent, whereof 75000 l. or 1 ½ per
Cent. is to be deducted, (by the difference of 2 or 3 per
Cent. that the New Coin shall be more in Quantity than
Weight). And the Owners of the Coin shall lose 650000 l.
or 13 per Cent. Whereof one per Cent. is to be deducted
by the Difference as above, viz.

    _ A Table to shew how to reduee Gradually the Price of the Ounce
Troy of Silver standard to its ancient Price of Five Shillings,
the same having first been raised to 6 s. 8 d. according to the
proposal heretofore, with this only difference that the Crown
peice of Silver (though it weighs, but 19 dw. 8 gr. ½) shall be
Current for 5 s. and be esteemed for an Ounce of Silver, and so
the Silver shall have 3 ⅓ per Cent benefit by the Coynage.

    _ A Table to Reduce gradually the Price of the Ounce Troy of
Gold Standard to 4 l. an Ounce. being esteemed Sixteen
times the value of Silver Weight for Weight) the same having
first been raised to 5 l. 6 s. 8 d. which is the proportion of
Silver to 6 s. 8 d. an Ounce, the Gold Standard Coined or
not Coined esteemed a like, by reason that Gold esteemed
16 times the value of Silver Weight for Weights, is the highest
Rate that ever was.

    _ A New PROPOSAL to Melt
down all the Old Hammer'd Mony
of England, and make New
Coin of the same Standard and
Price, as the present Milled
Mony is; and to supply the
Loss arising by Clipt Mony.

    _ A Computation of the whole Charge that the Nation
will be at, to make the Clipt Mony good to the
Owners thereof; besides the voluntary advance
of one Million in Clipt Mony towards the Mending
of it, by way of an Adventure, according to the
New Proposal.
